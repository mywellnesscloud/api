		<h4>
			Give attribution
		</h4>
		<p class="desc">
		We ask that you attribute mywellness cloud when you are using data from the mywellness cloud API (activities, user info, duration, calories burned, etc.). If you are using text to give attribution, we write “mywellness cloud” as two words without any capital letter, and ask that you do too.<br/><br/>
		You may use the following assets on your application’s default view/screen/page for the purpose of attribution.
			<ul>
				<li>Mywellness Logo</li>
				<li>mywellness Icon</li>
				<li>Powered by mywellness</li>
			</ul>
