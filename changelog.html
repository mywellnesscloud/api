			The mywellness cloud is an open platform that lets millions of people around the world track, measure and improve their health and fitness. The mywellness cloud API enables the exchange of select data in order to extend and augment the mywellness cloud user-experience and support complementary services in a collaborative wellness-ecosystem.<br />
			
			Three key principles govern the use of the mywellness cloud API:
			The data belongs to the user. We are stewards of the data and have an obligation to protect it and use it responsibly.
			Data can only be collected with explicit user permission. Only collect what you need and only use it as you say you will.
			User must have a mechanism to disable access and to request that any collected data be deleted.

			By visiting the Developer Portal, registering as a Developer and/or using the mywellness cloud API, you agree to abide by the terms and conditions set forth in the mywellness cloud API Terms of Use.<br />
